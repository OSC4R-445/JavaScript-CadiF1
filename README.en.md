# JavaScript Practice Repository

This repository contains my structured progress across 4 levels of difficulty. Each level includes 4 assignments designed to strengthen practical JavaScript skills.

## 🌟 Repository Structure

- **main**: Main branch of the repository.
- **lvl-1 to lvl-4**: Base branches for each difficulty level.
- **lvl-X_assign-Y**: Child branches for each specific assignment.

### 📁 Example branch naming:
- `lvl-1` → Base branch for Level 1
  - `lvl-1_assign-1` → First assignment of Level 1
  - `lvl-1_assign-2`, etc.
- `lvl-2` → Base branch for Level 2
  - `lvl-2_assign-1`, etc.

## 🧠 Purpose

Organize exercises by level and assignment to keep the codebase clean, accessible, and well-documented. This also helps with future reviews or contributions.
