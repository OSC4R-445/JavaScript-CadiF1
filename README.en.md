### 📖 History and Evolution of JavaScript
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1996 at the request of Netscape. In 1997, it became an ECMA standard, and today it is officially known as ECMAScript, although it is still commonly referred to as JavaScript.

#### Notable ECMAScript Versions:
- **ES5 (2009)**: Introduced JSON support, Array methods (forEach, map), and strict mode.
- **ES6 (2015)**: Major update introducing arrow functions, let/const, template literals, and classes.
- **ES7 (2017)**: Added async/await and array includes.

### 🚀 Core Features of JavaScript
- **Weak Typing**: Variables can change types during execution.
- **Object-Oriented**: Uses objects and prototypes for inheritance.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Code Blocks**: Uses curly braces `{}` to define blocks of code.

### 🌐 Including JavaScript in HTML
JavaScript can be included in HTML using three methods:
1. **Inline Scripts**: Placed directly within HTML tags.
2. **Internal Scripts**: Placed within `<script>` tags in the HTML.
3. **External Scripts**: Linked via the `src` attribute in `<script>` tags.

### 🛠️ Debugging with the Console
JavaScript's `console` object provides methods to log and display information:
- `console.log()`: General information and variable output.
- `console.warn()`: Warnings that indicate potential issues.
- `console.error()`: Errors indicating critical failures.

---

### ✏️ Variable Declaration and Data Types
JavaScript variables can be declared using `var`, `let`, and `const`:
- `var`: Function-scoped, allows redeclaration.
- `let`: Block-scoped, does not allow redeclaration.
- `const`: Block-scoped, requires initialization, immutable after assignment.

- The file is structured as an HTML document and covers all the required topics.  
- Hidden text exists for dark mode users as a playful element.
